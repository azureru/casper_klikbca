# Mutasi Checking
CasperJS based script untuk akses KlikBCA trough phantom headless browser
(so ya - a user's right isn't it? :P)

but this one is designed to be more terminal friendly (with proper return code and minimal stdout output)
(so you can embed it in node-red or bash or OpenHab or other automation tool)

# Why?
why not :) just don't abuse their server ok

# Use

```
casperjs mutasi_current.js {yourusername} {yourpassword}
casperjs mutasi_monthly.js {yourusername} {yourpassword}
```
